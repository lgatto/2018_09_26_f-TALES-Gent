## Title

Probabilistic modelling of protein sub-cellular localisation

## Abstract

In biology, localisation is function - understanding the sub-cellular
localisation of proteins is paramount to comprehend the context of
their functions. Mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics and
contemporary machine learning enable to build proteome-wide spatial
maps, informing us on the location of thousands of
proteins. Nevertheless, while some proteins can be found in a single
location within a cell, up to half of proteins may reside in multiple
locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown
functional compartment, leading to considerable uncertainty in
associating a protein to their sub-cellular location. Recent advances
enable us to probabilistically model protein localisation as well as
quantify the uncertainty in the location assignments, thus leading to
better and more trustworthy biological interpretation of the data.

## Short bio

Laurent Gatto is a professor of bioinformatics at the de Duve
Institute, UCLouvain, Belgium. His group develops novel algorithms,
scientific software and reproducible analyses pipelines to explore
omics data and understand the underlying biology. Since 2010, he has
produced the leading software suite and machine learning approaches to
study protein sub-cellular localisation using quantitative mass
spectrometry-based proteomics.
