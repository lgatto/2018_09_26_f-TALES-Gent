## Title

Probabilistic modelling of protein sub-cellular localisation

## Abstract

In biology, localisation is function - understanding the spatial
sub-cellular distribution of proteins is paramount to comprehend the
context of their function. Mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics
designs and contemporary machine learning enable to build
proteome-wide spatial maps, informing us on the sub-cellular location
of thousands of proteins. Nevertheless, while some proteins can be
found with a single location within a cell, up to half of proteins may
reside in multiple locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside
within an unknown functional compartment, leading to considerable
uncertainty in associating a protein to their sub-cellular
location. Recent advances enable us to probabilistically model protein
localisation as well as quantify the uncertainty in the location
assignments, thus leading to better and more trustworthy biological
interpretation of the data.


## Short bio

Laurent Gatto is a professor of bioinformatics at the de Duve
Institute, UCLouvain. He developes novel algortithms, scientific
software and reproducible analyses pipelines to explore omics data and
understand the underlying biology. Since 2010, he has produced the
leading software and machine learning approaches to study protein
sub-cellular localisation using quantitative mass spectrometry-based
proteomics.
